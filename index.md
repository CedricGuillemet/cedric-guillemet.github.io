I'm a software developer and this page is a memorandum of a few of the things I did over the years. I like the way pictures talk (especially when animated) so this page is not a resume but a visual reminder of things I loved working on.

# Sofware developer at Animal Logic
Now famous for the Lego movies franchise. I have the chance to work on the sequel of the Lego Movie. My mission at Animal Logic consists in making and improving existing tools for the Performance team. Basically handling animation, camera, faces. I've been credited in Lego Ninjago Movie.

# Sofware developer at Golaem
Golaem is a provider of solutions for crowd simulations. I started there in 2012. We had less than 10 clients and even less productions released. Nearly 5 years later, I'm very proud of what the team acheived. Close to 200 clients and dozen of released TV serie episods, movies and video games. I had the chance to work on:

- The realtime rendering pipeline
- The n-ped animation system
- Some behaviors like UV-Pin
- The paint system
- Internal QA toolchain
- The Cache Layout Tool
- many more smaller things

Last year and a half, I devoted my time to the Cache Layout Tool. It can be described as Photoshop for crowd simulations. You can select, move, delete, change trajectory, duplicate,... characters of the simulation. I designed the architecture and coded most of it. I'm especially proud of this feature because it spawned out as a stand alone product.

# Game developer
I've been a game developer for some years(2005-2007) at Fresh3D. I had the chance to release my first game on PlayStation2 : Mountain Bike Adrenaline. It didn't have a good Metacritic but I enjoyed coding all the terrain pipeline from scratch. I also started the PC DX9 conversion but left the company before its release. During those years I also had the chance to put my hands on a PlayStation 3 devkit. We were funded by Sony for an unreleased prototype called 'Strings Attached'. I worked on rendering tech(AO, shadows, SPU skinning). Some bits on audio, lua scripting,..
